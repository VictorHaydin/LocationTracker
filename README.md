LocationTracker
===============

Simple tracker that receives coordinates of moving objects, persists them to disk and calculate total travel distance for each of the objects. 

Based on [disruptor-net](https://github.com/odeheurles/Disruptor-net) - an open-source implementation of the [Disruptor](http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html) design pattern.
